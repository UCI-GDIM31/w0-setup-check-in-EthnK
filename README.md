# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Ethan Kim, and I use he/him pronouns. I have a deep interest in a variety of games, including FPS, MOBA, single-player, and RPG titles. I decided to take this class because I enjoy playing games and thought it would be both interesting and fun to learn how they’re made. I hope to build some kind of a shooting game, as those are the types of games I enjoy playing the most.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [0] Other - Environmental Engineering

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I’m hoping to learn the basics of making games in this class, especially the skills needed to build a game from scratch. I want to understand how to create the gameplay, design, and visuals for a game. I also hope to come out of the class with a project or game I can be proud of, while gaining a better understanding of how games are made.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I’m nervous because I’ve never used a game engine before, so everything will be completely new to me. I’m worried about how quickly I’ll be able to pick it up and whether I’ll understand all the technical aspects.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.
